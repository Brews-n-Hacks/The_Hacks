While I may not consider myself an expert developer in any scripting language, I’ve found myself capable of automating tasks both at work and in my personal life. When I'm asked if I can automate anything, I make the joke that "I would say I'm Python-literate." 

The beauty of scripting lies in its accessibility; you don’t need to be a coding guru to harness its power. Although I can’t share the specific scripts I’ve created for work due to confidentiality, I can certainly highlight some of my experiences with Bash and Python, particularly in automating false positive investigations.

My scripting goal for 2025 is to become more proficient in Rust scripting. I like the idea of compiling, and Rust is a memory-safe language I'd like to become more familiar with.
# Tips
Scripting is like prayer in several ways:
- The only way to get better is by doing it;
- Aside from syntax errors, there is no right or wrong way; there's only your way;
- And by paying attention from how others are doing it, you can improve your elegance over time.
## For Friends Who Need Encouragement - 
I've done my best to go back through and comment the approximate year my scripts have been written. So, you can take a look at how it's improved over time. 
**Your's will as well.**
